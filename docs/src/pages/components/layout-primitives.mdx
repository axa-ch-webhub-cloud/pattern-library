## Introduction

The `Pane` and `Card` components are one of the most important components in Evergreen.
They are used as primitives to construct layouts and compose components.
In most cases you can use a `Pane` instead of a `div` element.

The `Pane` and `Card` components map almost directly to the `Box` from [`ui-box`](https://github.com/axa-ch/patterns-library).
The `Box` component is a UI Primitive component that is used as the base of many components in Evergreen.

Besides the `Pane` and `Card` component, most other components use `Box` or `Pane` as well.

## What is a React UI Primitive?

The `Box` component is a base component or "UI primitive" for creating layouts and composing components.
Many components within Evergreen use the `Box` component instead of a element such as `div` or `button`.

The `Box` component is useful because it helps with 3 common use cases

- **Create layouts without helper classes.**
- **Define components without worrying about CSS.**
- **Override single properties when using components.**

### You don’t need `className`

In Evergreen most of the time you don’t deal with CSS classes through the `className` property.
Instead, you write CSS properties directly onto your Evergreen components —
in most cases it will just work.

_If you know what you are doing and do need to use CSS directly, be aware that mixing
Evergreen with regular CSS might give you unexpected results._

#### When to use inline styles?

In some cases you still want to use inline styles.
The most common use cases is when you are animating a CSS property and the value is always different.

## Creating layouts with Pane

Use the `Pane` component to create your layouts.
Most CSS properties are supported on the `Pane` component.

```jsx
// import { Pane, Text } from 'evergreen-ui'

<Pane
  height={120}
  width={240}
  display="flex"
  alignItems="center"
  justifyContent="center"
  border="default"
>
  <Text>Pane</Text>
</Pane>
```
