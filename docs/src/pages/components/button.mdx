## Evergreen exports multiple button components

- **Button**: most commonly used, can have a icon on the left or right side.
- **IconButton**: a button that holds a single icon.
- **BackButton**: a preset of the `Button` component.
- **TextDropdownButton**: a bare-bones button that is used primarily in table headers.

`Button`, `IconButton` and `BackButton` all share a very similar API and look.
`TextDropdownButton` is a bit different.

# Button

The `Button` component is the most common button component.
It contains a label and optional icons before or after the label.

```jsx
<Button appearance="primary">Hi Evergreen!</Button>
```
