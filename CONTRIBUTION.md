# Rules and Lintings

- We export only Web Components. No separate distribution of SASS mixins, JS, HTML and SCSS files.
- We will use [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Style Rules

- We follow DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles when we write SCSS. This includes variables, mixins, etc.
- We remove the linting of ordering and grouping of CSS properties. Only includes have to be at the beginning.
- We won't have settings for vertical rhythm or global spacing.

## JS Rules

- We reuse the Patterns Lib v1 JavaScript linting settings.

## Git Commit Messages

- are prefixed by JIRA/github issue number,
- reasonably self-contained,
- are in English only,
- written in present tense or imperative,
- start with an initial capital letter.
