# Policy features

With this component you can highlight as much `features` as you want. You can set a main title and put `features` items as childs to it.

## Versioning

You can version both, the `axa-policy-features` and the `axa-policy-features-item` tag.

To do so, use it like this:

```js
import createAXAPolicyFeatures from '@axa-ch-webhub-cloud/policy-features/lib/index.react';
import { createAXAPolicyFeaturesItem } from '@axa-ch-webhub-cloud/policy-features/lib/index.react';

createAXAPolicyFeatures(null, 'myteam'); // Enables tag `axa-policy-features-myteam`
createAXAPolicyFeaturesItem(null, 'myteam'); // Enables tag `axa-policy-features-item-myteam`
```

# axa-policy-features-item

You have to set `axa-policy-features-item` as childs of `axa-policy-features`. It renders a icon on top, a headline and a description text. Usage see examples above.

## Properties

### title

The attribute `title` (optional) specifies the title of your feature.

### icon

You can set a URL to a svg, for example `https://url-to-svg-icon.svg`. Instead of that you can set a svg as a string (if you import a icon or image from `@axa-ch-webhub-cloud/materials`).

The size of the svg will be set to:

- Tablet and bigger (`md-up`): 96x96 px
- All smaller devices: 42x42 px
