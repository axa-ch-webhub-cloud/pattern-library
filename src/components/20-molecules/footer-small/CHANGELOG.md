## 4.0.3

- Fixes dynamic updates of footer-small child elements. [#1549](https://github.com/axa-ch-webhub-cloud/pattern-library/issues/1549)

## 4.0.0

- The implementation of the wrapper to make a component React-ready has
  fundamentally changed. In particular, unknown Boolean- or
  string-valued properties are now accepted and converted to HTML
  attributes. E.g. `data-seleniumid="my-id"` is now supported.
- All defined attributes attached to a component _before_ component
  construction time are now taken into account. Conversely, all undefined
  component attributes are initialized with type-appropriate default
  values at this time. This may amount to a breaking change if the
  component consumer had previously assumed undefined or uninitialized
  behaviour.

## 3.0.0

- Child fragments replaced the JSON structure. This is a complete overhaul and you need to start from scratch. The biggest change apart from that will be, that `onLanguageClick` and `onDisclaimerClick` now fire the index of the element, instead of a name or a key.

## 2.0.0

- [Do not bother doing this, you should go straight to the 2.x to 3.x migration part and use the latest version]
  The necessary "key" property on the items was introduced. Not providing this key will break your component after upgrading.
