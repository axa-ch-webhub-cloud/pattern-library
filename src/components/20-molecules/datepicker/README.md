# AXA Datepicker

## Usage

```bash
npm install @axa-ch/datepicker
```

**Important:** If this component needs to run in Internet Explorer 11,
[you need to use our polyfill](https://github.com/axa-ch/patterns-library/tree/develop/src/components/05-utils/polyfill).

### Native Example

```js
import '@axa-ch/datepicker';

`<axa-datepicker locale="de-CH" year="2020" month="1" day="20"><axa-datepicker>`;
```

### React Example

Create a React-ified datepicker with the createElement function from your React version and then use it like this:

```js
import { createElement } from 'react';
import createAXADatepickerReact from '@axa-ch/datepicker/lib/index.react';

const AXADatepickerReact = createAXADatepickerReact(createElement);

export default AXADatepickerReact;
```

```js
<AXADatepickerReact locale="de-CH" year={2020} month={1} day={1} onDateChange={date => console.log(`date changed ${date}`)}>
</AxaDatepickerReact>
```

[Controlled-Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#the-select-tag) behaviour is supported when the `inputfield` property is set.

## Properties

### locale

The string-valued `locale` defines region-specific date rendering preferences such as separators etc. (default: `de-CH`).

_Note: Week start is hardwired to Monday, only its translation is influenced by `locale`._

### year

The number-valued `year` defines the start year of the datepicker (default: current year).

### month

The number-valued `month` defines the start month of the datepicker (default: current month).

_Note_: Numeric months are _zero_-based, i.e. January is 0.

### day

The number-valued `day` defines the start day of the datepicker (default: current day).

_Note_: Numeric days &le; 0 wrap around into the end of the _previous_ month
(cf. [MDN Date.setDate](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/setDate#Description)).

### inputfield

Boolean-valued `inputfield` toggles visibility of a free-form date-input field (default: `false`).

Input-field content is validated.

### allowedyears

The array-valued `allowedyears` specifies the years that will be visible in the date-picker dropdown. The `year` property value is an automatic member of `allowedyears`.

Both individual years `[2019,202]`,
year ranges `["1989-2010"]`, and a mix of the two `["1989-2010", 2012, 2014]` are supported.

### labelbuttoncancel, labelbuttonok, placeholder, monthtitle, yeartitle, invaliddatetext

These string-valued properties are all used to internationalize various texts in &lt;axa-datepicker&gt;:

- `labelbuttoncancel` is the text of the action button cancelling a date selection (default: `Schliessen`).

- `labelbuttonok` is the text of the action button approving a date selection (default: `OK`).

- `placeholder` is the placeholder text of the free-form date-input field (default: `Please select a date`).

- `monthtitle` is the text shown on the month dropdown when nothing is preselected (default: `Choose Month`).

- `yeartitle` is the text shown on the year dropdown when nothing is preselected (default: `Choose Year`).

- `invaliddatetext` is the text shown under the free-form date-input field when date validation fails (default:
  `Invalid date`).

### value

The string-valued `value` sets the content of the free-form date-input field. When reading from `value`, it contains
the date-input field's current content.

This property is especially relevant for controlled-component behaviour under React.

### defaultValue

The string-valued `defaultValue` sets the _initial_ content of the free-form date-input field.
This property is only available under React.

It is intended to be used in conjunction with `date`, which does not auto-reflect to the date-input field (
rather, only user-initiated input does).

_Note_: _initial_ refers to the [firstUpdated lifecyle point](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/lifecycle#firstupdated) of the component's internal lifecycle &mdash; the datepicker by construction is unaware of
external lifecycles such as React's.

As a consequence, React developers should avoid the pitfall of unnecessarily recreating a new instance of the datepicker from scratch on every property update, especially for `date` changes. Failure to do so not only incurs a performance penalty, it also causes `defaultValue` to be imposed after every (re)creation. This may in turn create the false impression that the datepicker is not reactive to property changes, since its input-field value would be always that of `defaultValue`.

### name

The string-valued `name` sets the name attribute of the free-form date-input field.

This property is especially relevant for using &lt;axa-datepicker&gt; inside a &lt;form&gt;.

### outputdate

The string-valued `outputdate` (read-only) reflects the currently selected date in the format of the
current locale.

### date

The `date` property takes a [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object to set the current internal date of the datepicker.

Setting `date` implies automatically derived values for `year`, `month`, and `day`.

Defining a `date` property does **not** imply controlled-component behaviour.

Likewise, `date` is **not** automatically reflected to the date input field. Rather, only _user input_ is.

### invalid

Boolean `invalid`, when set to true, forces showing the error message set with `invaliddatetext` even when user input is valid &mdash; _except_ when `invaliddatetext` is itself empty (technically, falsy).

The intended use case is to easily convey external validation failure, e.g. when an application decides the entered date is outside a permissible date range.

### width

String-valued `width` allows to override the intrinsic dimensions of the datepicker. Default is `100%`.
Note that there is a minimum of `260px` if you use it inline and `197px` if you use it as a inputfield.

Example values:

- `90%`: Sets percentage value of width of parent element.
- `400`: Sets px value of width of parent element. Note that missing `px` is added to numeric values automatically.

### height

String-valued `height` allows to override the intrinsic dimensions of the datepicker. Default is `40`.
Note that there is a minimum of `40px` if you use it as a inputfield. Note that you can't change height if you use it inline.

Example values:

- `90%`: Sets percentage value of height of parent element. Don't forget to set parent's height in this case.
- `300`: Sets px value of height of parent element. Note that missing `px` is added to numeric values automatically.

### label

String-valued `label` sets a label text above the input-field part of the datepicker.

### required

Boolean `required`, when true, adds a star after the `label` text to visually convey to the user that filling this input-field datepicker is mandatory.

### disabled

Boolean `disabled`, when true, disables the datepicker, both in terms of keyboard input and dropping down the datepicker proper.

This state is visually conveyed to the user via suitable grey colours.

### checkMark

Boolean `checkMark`, when true, paints a checkmark icon after the datepicker.

Its intended use is in conjunction with external validation.

### autofocus

Boolean `autofocus`, when true, sets keyboard focus on the input field after initial rendering of a datepicker configured for `inputfield` mode.

## Callback Properties

### onChange

The function-valued attribute `onChange` can be used as a callback prop for React and other frameworks.
The callback is invoked on every [`input`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/input_event) event
emitted from the free-form date-input field.
It is also invoked whenever the user presses the OK button to accept a date selected from the calendar.

This property is especially relevant for controlled-component behaviour under React.

An `input` event with `target:{value}` is passed as parameter 1 of the callback, in which `value` represents
the new date-input string from the free-form date-input field.

Note that due to `input` event characteristics, pasting date strings into the free-form date-input field is supported (unlike in native &lt;input type="date"&gt;).

### onDateChange

The function-valued attribute `onDateChange` can be used as a callback prop for React and other frameworks.

The callback is invoked once for every _user input_ change that results in a valid date under the current locale and `allowedyears` restrictions.

A valid [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object is passed as parameter 1 of the callback.

### onFocus, onBlur

The function-valued attributes `onFocus, onBlur` can be used as callback props for React and other frameworks.

The respective callbacks are invoked with the original native event as their only parameter whenever the free-form date-input field receives or loses focus. As such, they only make sense together with the `inputfield` attribute.

## Events

The custom events `axa-change` and `change` are fired on &lt;axa-datepicker&gt; itself whenever `onDateChange` fires (see above). Their `event.detail` value is the `value` property for `axa-change` (a string), and a `{value, date, name}` object for `change`.

Both events do _not_ bubble up through the DOM.

The custom event `axa-input` is fired on &lt;axa-datepicker&gt; itself whenever the free-form date-input field's `input` event fires.
Its `event.detail` value is a `{value, date, name}` object, with `value` being the current input-field value, `date` being a corresponding `Date` instance if valid (`null` otherwise), and `name` as defined above.

The intended usage is for native applications using the datepicker in conjunction with e.g. inline event listeners.

This functionality is not available in controlled-component mode.
