## 4.0.2

## 4.0.0

- The implementation of the wrapper to make a component React-ready has
  fundamentally changed. In particular, unknown Boolean- or

  attributes. E.g. `data-seleniumid="my-id"` is now supported.

## 3.0.0

- All defined attributes attached to a component _before_ component
  construction time are now taken into account. Conversely, all undefined
  component attributes are initialized with type-appropriate default
  values at this time. This may amount to a breaking change if the
  component consumer had previously assumed undefined or uninitialized
  behaviour.

## 2.0.0

- The large property is obsolete, use size property like `size="large"`
