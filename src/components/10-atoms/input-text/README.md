# AXA Input Text

The &lt;axa-input-text&gt; component is a wrapper for the HTML &lt;input&gt; element with custom styling and additional functionality.
It accepts most of the same properties as HTML &lt;input&gt;, but with `type`restricted to `type=text`, `type=email`, or `type=password`.

## Properties

### type

The type of input element to display.

| Attribute         | Details   |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| `type="text"`     | (default) |
| `type="email"`    | Email     |
| `type="password"` | Password  |

### label

The string-valued `label` provides the label text as HTML.

_Note: The application is responsible for sanitizing HTML!_

### refId

The string-valued `refId` sets the reference ID for label and input. If no `refId` is set, a random ID will be created.

### name

The string-valued `name` of the element can be set for purposes of form submission.

_Note: See the [specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#naming-form-controls:-the-name-attribute) for further details._

### maxLength

Numeric `maxLength`, when defined, restricts the number of characters a user can enter. The underlying native &lt;input&gt; enforces `maxLength` by blocking user input when the character limit is exceeded.

The remaining characters are always displayed to the user, if `maxLength` and `counter` is provided.

The UI's remaining-characters message (see `counter`) will however use `maxLength - 1` internally to be able to provide advance warning when 0 characters remain. Upon hitting the character limit proper the 'character limit reached!' error message (see `counterMax`) is displayed instead.

### counter

String-valued `counter` defines the UI's remaining-characters message in conjunction with `maxLength`.

Valid `counter` values are:

- the empty string, which will cause that character count not to be displayed.
- a nonempty string suffix, which will be appended to the remaining character count
- a string template containing "##counter##", so that e.g. "still ##counter## characters left" will result in instantiated text like "still 9 characters left".

### counterMax

String-valued `counterMax` defines the validation error message that the user will see upon reaching `maxLength` characters.

### required

The Boolean attribute `required` visualizes an element that must obligatorily be filled by the user. When set to true, the element displays `*` after the label text.

### placeholder

The string-valued `placeholder` specifies the placeholder text shown when the element is empty.

### invalid

The Boolean attribute `invalid` serves to indicate the validity of the element (default: `false`). If set to `true` it sets the element into a visual error state.

### checkMark

The Boolean attribute `checkMark`, when set to true, shows an animated check mark to the right of the input (default: `false`).

### value

The string-valued `value` sets the value of the underlying native HTML &lt;input&gt;

### defaultValue

The string-valued `defaultValue` can only be used for React.

Like `value`, it sets the value of the underlying native HTML &lt;input&gt; &mdash; _but_ only once, on first render.

### disabled

The Boolean attribute `disabled` disables the underlying native HTML &lt;input&gt; text.

### error

The string-valued `error` provides error text as HTML.

This is the text shown when `invalid` is true.

### info

The string-valued `info` provides the label text as HTML.

_Note: The application is responsible for sanitizing HTML!_

### pattern

It is a string value. But just input a valid RegEx. Useful to open up numeric keyboard on iOS touch devices. See official HTML documentation for details.

Default: `.*`. This RegEx do not restrict any input. An empty string at this point causes errors on form validation, because it just allows to input a empty string.

### inputmode

It is a string value. Useful to open up numeric keyboard on touch devices. See official HTML documentation for details.

### autofocus

The Boolean attribute autofocus, when true, sets keyboard focus on the underlying native &lt;input&gt; element after initial rendering of the component.

### currency

You can set the `currency` attribute to a valid [ISO 4217 currency code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) string. When set, &lt;input-text&gt; formats the input whenever the `onBlur` event of its internal input element fires, and also upon setting `value` programmatically. Note that the locale "style" remains fixed to `de-CH`.

Currency formatting is only active when attribute `type` is set to `text`. The formatter does not accept values which are either only letters ("one hundred") or have more than one decimal separator ("12.30.1").

Please be mindful of using currency formatting in combination with `maxLength`. The result of formatting could exceed the limits of `maxLength`!

## Callbacks

### onChange

The function-valued property `onChange` can be used as a callback prop for React and other frameworks.

Its first argument is the original `change` event from the element's underlying native &lt;input&gt; field.
The second argument is a Boolean flag `invalidFormat` which is true if, and only if, the user's input cannot be formatted as a currency.

### onFocus

The function-valued property `onFocus` can be used as a callback prop for React and other frameworks.

Its only argument is the original `focus` event from the element's underlying native &lt;input&gt; field.

### onBlur

The function-valued property `onBlur` can be used as a callback prop for React and other frameworks.

Its only argument is the original `blur` event from the element's underlying native &lt;input&gt; field.

### onKeyDown

The function-valued attribute `onKeyDown` can be used as a callback prop for React and other frameworks.

The callback is invoked once for every _user key down_ on the inputfield.

### onKeyUp

The function-valued attribute `onKeyUp` can be used as a callback prop for React and other frameworks.

The callback is invoked once for every _user key up_ on the inputfield.

## Methods

### focus()

The `focus()` method focusses the underlying native HTML &lt;input&gt;.

Its UI consequences are the same as a keyboard/mouse-initiated focus.

### blur()

The `blur()` method unfocusses the underlying native HTML &lt;input&gt;.

Its UI consequences are the same as a keyboard/mouse-initiated blur.
