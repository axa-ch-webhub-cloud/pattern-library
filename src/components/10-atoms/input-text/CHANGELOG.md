## 3.0.3

- Safari had an issue with the cursor on all platforms, which is hereby fixed.

## 3.0.0

- The implementation of the wrapper to make a component React-ready has
  fundamentally changed. In particular, unknown Boolean- or
  string-valued properties are now accepted and converted to HTML
  attributes. E.g. `data-seleniumid="my-id"` is now supported.
- All defined attributes attached to a component _before_ component
  construction time are now taken into account. Conversely, all undefined
  component attributes are initialized with type-appropriate default
  values at this time. This may amount to a breaking change if the
  component consumer had previously assumed undefined or uninitialized
  behaviour.

## 2.4.7

- If no counter text is given the character count will not be displayed.
