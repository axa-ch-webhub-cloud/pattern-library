# Input file

Input-File provides a clickable element, which can be used in forms to upload files. The upload function can be restricted with several attributes. They may display text, icons, or both. Input-File can be styled via properties like the [axa-button](https://github.com/axa-ch-webhub-cloud/pattern-library/blob/develop/src/components/10-atoms/button/README.md).

## Properties

### text

The String attribute `text` sets the text of the component.

### variant

| Attribute             | Details                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `variant="secondary"` | Button in a ghost state |
| `variant="red"`       | Button red              |
| `variant="inverted"`  | Button inverted         |

### icon

Based on the string-valued attribute `icon`, interpreted as icon name, an icon will be rendered. To see the full list of possible icons, see the [axa-icon](https://github.com/axa-ch-webhub-cloud/pattern-library/blob/develop/src/components/10-atoms/icon/README.md) README.

### large

The Boolean attribute `large` specifies the size of an input file. Setting this attribute will change the height of an input file.

### motionOff

The Boolean attribute `motionoff` deactivates hover animation.

### disabled

The Boolean attribute `disabled` disables the input file, but not natively like in the button.

### accept

The String attribute `accept` specifies a filter for which file types the user can pick from.

| Attribute                                   | Details                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `accept=""`                                 | Allow every file type                         |
| `accept="image/*"`                          | Files with media type image are accepted      |

| `accept="audio/*"`                          | Files with media type audio are accepted      |

| `accept="image/jpg, image/jpeg, image/png"` | Allow multiple file types                     |

### capture

The Boolean attribute `capture` indicates that the capture of media directly from the deviceâ€™s camera and/or microphone is preferred.

| Attribute                            | Details                           |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `capture`                            | Allow capturing media from device |
| `accept="audio/*" capture="capture"` | Allow capturing audio from device |
| `accept="video/*" capture=""`        | Allow capturing video from device |

You can restrict the different media types like audio, video or photo with the accept attribute.

### multiple

The Boolean attribute `multiple` specifies how many file the user can select.

### onChange

The function-valued attribute `onChange` can be used as a callback prop for React and other frameworks.
